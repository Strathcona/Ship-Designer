#This is an Example Conversation.
#Each line corresponds to a conversation element in a conversation tree.
#Each line is assigned an ID equal to its order, first line is 1, second 2, ect, ignoring comments that start with # or empty lines
#Each line has a type, that determines what the parser looks for, followed by a colon
#all elements have an int, which is the ID of the next line
#TEXT elements just contain a string to display
#CHOICE elements have a few different elements
#A list of strings to display to the user as options
#A list of strings to use as variables to store the responses. You can reference these in Branch elements
#A list of true or false to correspond to values you set your variables to
#true or false lowercase. Anything not 'true' is going to be interpreted as false
#Choices don't branch by themselves, they just set various variables, you still need a next element, usually a branch
#If there are fewer variables and bools than there are choices, then the corresponding options just won't set any variables
#BRANCH checks a list of variables, and if they all match their conditions, goes to the ID specified
#Each branch has a list of list of variable names, one list per branch
#Note the double brackets, one set around all the lists, then another set around each individual list
#Each Branch has a corresponding list of list of bools that are the desired values of the variable names
#Each branch has a list of ints that correspond to the ID of the line to go to should all variable values match the branch conditions
#If multiple branch conditions are true, it goes to the first
#If no branch conditons are true, it goes to the next element
#END tags end the conversation, they don't have a next int
#Setting a variable more than once just overrides the variable
